It’s been approximately a year since I decided to learn how to code. It has been fun but not easy. In this article, I explain things I learnt along the way and some misconceptions I had about learning how to code.

## Language delusion
Learning how to code usually starts out by picking a computer language to learn. 
This is one of the most confusing decisions I had to make. 
You come across so many languages but can’t decide on one because you’re asking yourself questions like “What does X offer that Y doesn’t?”. 
A common confusion is trying to understand the relationship between Javascript and Java due to their names. 
After surfing the net, and getting suggestions, I concluded on Javascript.

At the end of the day, it occurred to me that the decision should be based on what you want to do (I didn’t understand then). 
The question now was how do I go about learning it? I searched for resources and ended up having about 10 Javascript books on my to-read list.
Now is where language delusion comes into play. 
I believed once I can learn the ins and out of Javascript — the core language, I would be a code guru, and be able to build apps as I liked (arguable).  

As time went by, it dawned on me that it’s more than knowing a language. 
I started understanding what concepts like front-end, back-end, database, frameworks, and the likes meant and how they all fit together. 
Wow! It wasn’t as easy as I thought but I kept pushing. 
Today I find myself doing Native Android development with Java and I can confidently tell you that “You can know Java(Kotlin?) but if you want to build native android apps, you must also know how to build android apps”. 
In essence, “You can know X language but if you want to build Y, you must know how to build Y using X”— that’s my point. 
It’s actually not as easy as it looks.

## Unnecessary note taking
“How do I remember all these syntax, functions, etc.?” This is the question I asked myself while learning from various resources. 
I ended up taking notes. A notebook became two, and so on. 
Initially, they were helpful for quick reference when I got lost. As time went by, there was actually no need for notes. 
The internet became my point of reference. This is where you start having many tabs opened, a new browser window would be needed for the sake of organization. 
The key here is not to focus too much on understanding the ins and out of a concept but have a basic idea of it, so when you need it, you have a sort of indicator to help you find your way out of an issue you’re facing. 
Then you can do an appropriate search for a solution to the issue.

## Don't beat yourself up
There were times I didn’t understand what I was learning, I sometimes felt overwhelmed. 
This is expected. I remember not being able to solve a quiz from a book simply because I didn’t understand how scopes worked, so my code wasn’t working as expected. 
Looking back that was a little problem. And that’s how it goes. 
It is initially not that easy to understand a new concept, but the more you attempt to understand something, the better your chances of understanding it (simple logic). 
As a good programmer, it is good to understand how something works instead of just copying code. 
I’ve found out that curiosity also works, it leads you to knowing more, and probably understand something you didn’t previously understand. 
Learning from multiple sources also helps.

## One way road
I always thought there was one way to solve a problem and if I didn’t know that particular way I would get stuck. I was wrong. 
The beauty of programming is that there is usually more than one way of solving a problem, to say the least. 
The question to be answered is if your solution is optimal, which is part of being a good programmer, because it is sometimes quite easy to come up with a solution.

## You've not landed
There were times I believed I’ve learnt enough and I know it all, so it was time to start building on that idea I had, lol. 
I remember wanting to build a web app, but I didn’t even know how to start due to knowledge gap. 
It turns out you’re always constantly learning in this game and you’ve not landed, and may not land soon. 
This kind of links to the language delusion point because you now have to learn some other things like SDKs, architectural patterns, frameworks, libraries, API communications, testing, and the likes.

#### And finally…

## You don’t know tomorrow
It’s easy to set out titles for yourself like “I want to be a web developer”, “I want to be an Android Developer”, “I want to be an iOS Developer”, “I want to be a back-end developer”, “I want to be a full-stack developer” etc. 
I started out with web development, now I’m on Android development. Tomorrow? I seriously don’t know but I’ll still be on Android. 
The fact is that you never know what you’ll become. 
One may even end up delving into other technologies like Blockchain, Machine learning, Internet of Things, and the likes. 
So while embracing what you currently are, know that you may be something else tomorrow.

It’s been an eventful year looking at where I am now in comparison with when I started. My advice to those also on this learning path is to keep on going, because it’s easy to give up. It’s not going to be easy but keep pushing, even the experts were once beginners.
